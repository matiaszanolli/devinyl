# DEVINYL - Recover vynils beyond recovering

This project started as a proof of concept that old vynils could be recovered at least a bit behind all the noise, crackling and clipping captured by the record player. It's still a work in progress, but since results seem to be decent enough to start working on more advanced features (like a lightweight Wiener filter capturing a portion of only noise, allowing a much cleaner filter).

It needs a reference audio. Preferably something that covers most of the audio spectrum without saturating will do fine, like most of 90's rock or pop records for example. But that's the thing. There's not an exact formula for every song, so feel free to experiment and check out the variation on the results!
